
QU_Decompostion.py is a python script which can find the eigenvalues of any square matrix. When running the scipt the user has two main options, firstly they can find the eigenvalues of a system of n identical particles connected by n+1 identical springs. On the otherhand, they can write their own matrix called matrix and find the eigenvalues for this custom square matrix.

The function Eigenvalue takes in 4 inputs, these are:
-n the number of rows/columns in your square matrix. For a harmonic oscillator system this would reflect the number of particles.
-N the number of itterations which QU decompostion is run for, I usually recommened keeping this greater than 20.
-constant, this is a boolean. If the value is True then we solve for a chanin of idnetical particles, if false then the user will input a square matrix.
-matrix, when constant is False the user is requried to write their own custom matrix in the .py file. This is used if the user want's non identical particles.

The code is designed around finding the natual frequcnies for a coupled harmonic oscillator but it is equally applicable to finding the eigenvalues of any square matrix.
